            simple instructions to show my design & engineering chops: Go through the app, make note of UX problems, and design any necessary solutions.

              <p>
                Prior to the summer of 2017 Lighthouse (at the time) was fully remote, with the CEO stateside and a couple engineers team off-shore.
                No formal designers to speak of, and the overall UI, UX, and IA was puzzled togehter by way of engineering, time, and customer constraints. Come July 2017, Lighthouse
                onboarded its state-side founding engineer, Jay, who charged me with the amazingly fun task (not being sarcastic here) of sifting through a SaaS app, designing solutions around any perceived UX problems, and

                Working with Jay (founding engineer) & Jason (founder and CEO) during my interview, I was able to discover, at a high-level, what some common challenges for both the user and Lighthouse were. Coupled with a need for some visual love, Lighthouse users needed to:

              <p>
                After playing around with the app a bit and getting used to the (then) current workflow, I chose one specific page to work on, the user Dashboard. After mocking out some changes I would make and light wireframing, I made some high(er) fidelity mocks to have a guide that I could follow when I code up the changes.
                For my first pass at implementing some changes I wanted to work on a few visual tweaks:

              <ul class="c-list c-list-u">
                <li>lighten up the color palette a bit to resolve any distractions on the page</li>
                <li>
                  tighten up any block of text <i>wider</i> than 600px for readability
               </li>
                <li>make the existing components more robust</li>

                After my on-site I was given an offer that serendipitously landed on my birthday (yep, I was offered a job on my birthday). About 2 weeks after my interview my initial redesign of some core components, color palette, and app layout deployed; I would proceed to work on a more robust and large scale redesign over the next 6 months while working on new features and code refactoring.

              <p>The data and feedback collected from UX feedback through customer development sessions I performed with our customers, design sessions with the CEO, and results from quarterly product surveys Lighthouse sent to our customers helped me understand the our users and by April of 2017 Lighthouse launched the app-wide redesign I had worked on tirelessly.</p>

              <p>
                Over the course of 6 months Lighthouse had gone through 2 redesigns: one when I onboarded and made slight and subtle enhancements, and another 6 months later that revamped the whole UI and overall UX. Almost immediately Lighthouse received positive feedback once the overall redesign was released. Current users were delighted by the softer color palette and refreshed UI components, and the churn rate decreased from 6.45% to 2.75%!
