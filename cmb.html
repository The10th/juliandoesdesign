                After exploring Lighthouse for a few minutes, and getting used to the workflow, I chose one specific page to work on: the user Dashboard. Following some light sketching and wireframing, I made some high(ish) fidelity mocks to use as a guide for the development portion of my interview.
                I decided to focus on a few visual tweaks:

                Over the course of 6 months Lighthouse had gone through 2 redesigns: one when I onboarded and made slight and subtle enhancements, and another 6 months later that revamped the whole UI and overall UX. Almost immediately Lighthouse received positive feedback once the overall redesign was released. Current users were delighted by the softer color palette and refreshed UI components, and the churn rate decreased from 6.45% to 2.75%!

                Manager Score was to be a stand alone application, able to be utilized independent of Lighthouse. Managers and leaders could utilize the tool to receive anonymous feedback from their team members - with metrics and analysis on identifying areas they could improve upon.
                Here, I was tasked with designing and building:

              <p>
                Given the sensitive nature of completely candid surveys on a manager provided by their team members, there were a few challenges that were discovered during customer development research. A few FUDS (fears, uncertainties, doubts) needed to be addressed for both managers and their team members if Manager Score was to be successful.
              </p>
              <ul class="c-list c-list-u">
                <li>managers need to trust the platform with their team memeber's emails (to provide the Manager Score survey invitation)</li>
                <li>team members have to be made aware that the feedback they provide are 100% anonymous</li>
                <li>managers want to know what questions are being asked on the survey</li>

              <p>
                All assumptions and features need validation prior to any active commitment to a project - and that is why we utilized a wonderful tactic that helped guide the design and development of Manager Score:
                <i>we beta tested with a current customer</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                Our findings from an initial (and very manual) beta run gave us terrific insights on how managers & their team wanted to interact with the app. We even built a feature into Manager Score from our findings from the test run.

                Manager Score was well received at first launch. A few iterations on the onboarding flow and metrics analysis were needed to fine tune the presentation of data, but overall successful. From a chain of fitness studios, to tech consulting firms, and Silicon Valley startups - managers, leaders, and teams of spanning a litany professions used Manager Score
                to gather insights on management performance.

            Lighthouse grew with the features and enhancements the team had made through to the end of 2016. In 2017, we wanted to introduce a type of 1 on 1 meeting that helps c-level leaders (directors & executives) a way to grow & retain their employees.

                In 2016 a fair amount of passive and active feedback requesting a "skip-levelesque" feature was received at Lighthouse.
                To obtain robust & detailed insights into the Skip-level needs of our users, Lighthouse dove deep into the 2016 Q4 Product Survey, and validated what had to be designed & built in Q1 2017.

                After metrics dissemination & initial expereince storyboarding we became aware that Skip Levels can potentially introduce disconnected and jarring expereinces for our users.
                While delivering a metrics proven positive feature is important and non-existent on the market, we did not want to provide users jagged experiences, possible leading to churn.

                Skip-levels launched early April of 2017 and the reception was resoundingly positive. We overcame the UX & UI hurdles for a potentially complex feature, provided our c-levels with everything they needed, and enhanced how they track meeting items between their different 1 on 1s.
                Current c-level users of the platform we delighted, and Lighthouse increased in company-wide monthly subscriptions expansions by
